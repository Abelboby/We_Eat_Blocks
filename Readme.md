# CarbonX - Blockchain-Based Carbon Credit Platform

## üöÄ Project Description
CarbonX is an innovative blockchain-based platform designed to revolutionize carbon credit verification, tracking, and trading. The platform empowers companies to register sustainability initiatives, submit verifiable environmental reports, and receive carbon credits through a transparent blockchain system. It features advanced NDVI (Normalized Difference Vegetation Index) analysis for scientifically validating environmental impact using satellite imagery.

## üõ† Tech Stack
- **Frontend**: React.js, Vite, Tailwind CSS, Framer Motion
- **Backend**: Ethereum Smart Contracts, Solidity
- **Data Analysis**: NDVI Satellite Imagery Processing
- **Libraries**: Leaflet (for mapping), Web3.js (for blockchain integration)
- **Deployment**: Vercel

## üì¶ Prerequisites
- Node.js (v16+)
- npm (v8+)
- MetaMask wallet extension for browser
- Internet connection for satellite data access

## üîß Installation & Setup

1. Clone the repository
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/kichuman28/We_Eat_Blocks.git
   cd We_Eat_Blocks/carbonx
   ```

2. Install dependencies
   ```bash
   npm install
   ```

3. Configure Environment Variables
   
   - Create a `.env` file in the root directory
   - Add necessary configuration details
     
   ```
   VITE_CONTRACT_ADDRESS=your_contract_address
   VITE_SATELLITE_API_KEY=your_satellite_api_key
   ```

4. Run the Application
   ```bash
   npm run dev
   ```

## üåü Key Features

Secure admin panel for verifying companies and reports, minting carbon credit tokens, and maintaining platform integrity through blockchain verification.

## How It Works

1. **Company Registration**: Organizations register on the platform using their blockchain wallet
2. **Report Submission**: Verified companies submit sustainability reports with evidence including geographic coordinates
3. **Scientific Verification**: Reports are verified using blockchain and NDVI analysis
4. **Carbon Credit Tokenization**: Verified environmental actions are tokenized as carbon credits
5. **Transparent Trading**: Credits can be tracked, transferred, and traded with full transparency
